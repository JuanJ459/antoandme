    <h1>Us <3</h1>
    <p>I'm going back to 505
        If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
        In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
        With your hands between your thighs
        Stop and wait a sec
        When you look at me like that, my darlin', what did you expect?
        I'd probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
        Or I did last time I checked
        Not shy of a spark
        The knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
        Frightened by the bite, though it's no harsher than the bark
        The middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
        I'm going back to 505
        If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
        In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
        With your hands between your thighs
        But I crumble completely when you cry
        It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
        I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
        Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
        I'm going back to 505
        If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
        In my imagination, you're waitin' lyin' on your side
        With your hands between your thighs and a smile
        Hoy conspiran mis suspiros
En contra de mis ganas cuando pasas
Y te miro
Y más allá de lo instintivo
Tus ojos tienen algo que me deja pensativo
Y si te doy mi vida
Y no es de tu medida, amor
Verás que el mejor sastre
Es hacer un desastre con mi corazón
¿Qué se siente que me gustes tanto, amor?
Que debo de aceptar que
Tengo miedo de tu encanto
¿Qué se siente que me gustes tanto, amor?
Que si un día tú te vas con alguien más
Yo voy también
Y si te doy mi vida
Y no es de tu medida, amor
Verás que el mejor sastre
Es hacer un desastre con mi corazón
¿Qué se siente que me gustes tanto, amor?
Que debo de aceptar que
Tengo miedo de tu encanto
¿Qué se siente que me gustes tanto, amor?
Que si un día tú te vas con alguien más
Yo voy también
        Quiero que te quedes a ver el atardecer
        Agarrar tu mano y sentir
        Que hay un camino mejor que caer (uh-uh)
        Yo no te esperaba, te doy la bienvenida
        En esta casa hay mucha oscuridad
        Pero viniste tú
        Con tu luz y tus herramientas
        Para reparar
        La, la, la, la, laralará
        De palabras me has dicho que no sabes mucho
        Mejor, nada duradero es de papel
        Constrúyeme un recinto con las manos
        Donde no hay, no hay que temer
        Yo no te esperaba, te doy la bienvenida
        En esta casa no hay oscuridad
        Porque viniste tú
        Con tu luz y tus herramientas
        Para reparar
        Y haces con estrellas un móvil para mí
        Hazme un edificio que sea un poema
        Un poema para mí
        Hazme un edificio que sea un poema
        Un poema para mí
        Hazme y hazme
        Un poema para mí
        Hazme un
        Quiero que te quedes a ver el atardecer
        What's wrong?
You've been askin' but I don't have an answer
How come?
I'm still thinkin' let's pretend to fall asleep now
When we get old, will we regret this?
Too young to think about all that shit
And stallin' only goes so far when you've got a head start
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from askin', "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feelin' lonely, you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
Feels like I've known you my whole life
I can see right through your lies
I don't know where we're going
But I'd like to be by your side
If you could tell me how you're feelin'
Maybe we'd get through this undefeated
Holdin' on for so long
'Cause we could stay at home and watch the sunset
But I can't help from askin', "Are you bored yet?"
And if you're feelin' lonely, you should tell me
Before this ends up as another memory
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie? (Yeah, oh)
Will you tell the truth so I don't have to lie?
        You know I need your love, 
You got that hold over me
Long as I got your love, 
You know that I'll never leave
When I wanted you to share my life, 
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, 
woman, 
right down the line
I know how much I lean on you, 
Only you can see
Changes that I've been through, 
Have left their mark on me
You've been as constant as the northern star, 
The brightest light that shines
It's been you, 
woman, 
right down the line
I just wanna say this is my way
Of telling you everything,
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way 
of telling you that everyday, 
I'm loving you so much more
Cause you believed in me 
through my darkest night
Put something better inside of me, 
You brought me into the light
Threw away all those crazy dreams, 
I put them all behind
And it was you, 
woman, 
right down the line
I just wanna say 
this is my way
Of telling you everything, 
I could never say before
Yeah this is my way 
of telling you that everyday, 
I'm loving you so much more
If I should doubt myself, 
If I'm losing ground
I wont turn to someone else, 
They'd only let me down
When I wanted you to share my life, 
I had no doubt in my mind
And it's been you, 
woman, 
right down the line
Ey, ey
El sol salió a janguear con las nube'
Y me regalaron un día cabrón
Como cuando me quedaba en Boquerón
O en Manatí
Lo mejor nunca se sube
Al menos que en la radio salga esta canción
Hoy vo'a darle paz a mi corazón
Por eso me perdí
Me fui de vacacione'
Con muchas cerveza' y cancione'
Un shot
Por las buenas amistade'
Y por las bendicione'
Y si el día se pone feo
Tú me lo haces bonito
Ya no pido más deseo'
Tengo todo lo que necesito
Ey, ey
Mi shorty con la gente
Que quiere saberlo to'
Si pongo el location
Ya no e' un secret spot
Hoy vo'a pasarla bien
Y no pensar en na'
Y no pensar en na'
Y no pensar en na'
Porque a veces pienso tanto
Que me olvido de dar gracias cuando me levanto
A veces pienso tanto
Que me olvido de pensar en mí
Que me olvido hasta de dormir, ey
Así que no se asusten si desaparezco
Un rato bien lejo', yo me lo merezco
No me hablen del trabajo,
No me hablen de escuela
Que ya subí el ancla y abrí las vela'
Puedo ver el paraíso llegando a Isabela
Un mango de Mayagüe' y despué' pa' La Palguera
Puerto Rico se ve lindo hasta en Google Maps
Y hoy le quiero dar la vuelta con Sensei, con Gabs
Lo que traigo es vibra linda
No quiero frontear
Pa' la' babie' yo después
Saco un disco de trap
No me busque'
:::Te amo xdxd:::
Que no me va' a encontrar
No me va' a encontrar, no, no
Me fui de vacacione'
Con muchas cerveza' y cancione'
Un shot
Por las buenas amistade'
Y por las bendicione'
Y si el día se pone feo
Tú me lo haces bonito
Ya no pido más deseo'
Tengo todo lo que necesito
Ey, ya no pido más deseo'
Tengo todo lo que necesito
Yeah, yeah
The world is so small 'til it ain't, yeah
I'm building up a wall 'til it break
She hate it when I call and it's late
I don't wanna keep you waitin'
I hope I never keep you waitin', yeah
I think I know it all but I don't
Why you always at the mall when you broke? Yeah
And I just wanna ball
Maybe dunk but I've never been tall, yeah
I might trip, I never fall
God knows I came close (don't try this at home)
I know I probably need to do better, fuck whoever
Keep my shit together
You never told me being rich was so lonely
Nobody know me, oh well
Hard to complain from this five-star hotel
I'm always in a rush
I've been thinking too much but
Keep it on the hush, no one need to know, just us
That's really all it takes
We don't need nothing but today (day), today (day)
Today (day), today (day)
The world is so small 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm building up a wall 'til it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin' (I hope I never keep you waitin')
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Woo (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Yeah, got a bad attitude, playin' 'til I'm out of moves
No need for shame, I get more peace at slow speeds
Go beat the game, young control freak
It's cold in my veins, I'm below freezing
Snow season (made me)
They know that I so need my space
Don't wanna grow old, so I smoke just in case
She say that I glow below the waist
And a stroke is just so PGA
All I got is a little bit of space and time
Drawing shapes and lines of the world we made
Tomorrow may be right around the corner
But I swear it's gon' be worth it if I make you wait
There's somewhere above, you keep reaching up
That's really all it takes (that's really all it takes)
We don't need nothing but today (day), today (day)
Today (day), today (day)
The world is so small 'til it ain't
('Til it ain't, 'til it ain't, 'til it ain't)
I'm building up a wall 'til it break
('Til it break, 'til it break, 'til it break)
She hate it when I call and it's late
(And it's late, and it's late)
I don't wanna keep you waitin' (I don't wanna keep you waitin')
I hope I never keep you waitin'
Yeah, nine times out of ten, I get it wrong
That's why I wrote this song, told myself to hold on
I can feel my fingers slippin'
In a motherfuckin' instant, I'll be gone
Do you want it all if it's all mediocre?
Starin' at the wall and the wall's full of posters
Lookin' at my dreams, who I wanna be
I guess you gotta see it to believe
Ooh, I been a fool but that's cool
That's what human beings do
Keep your eyes to the sky, never glued to your shoes
Guess there was a time when my mind was consumed
But the sun comin' out now, clouds start to move
Don't tell me nothin' but the truth
I'm tired, I don't gotta spare a second
Win or lose, win or lose
I don't keep count, nobody checking

        Daylight
        I wake up feeling like you won't play right
        I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
        It made me put away my pride
        So long
        You made a nigga wait for some, so long
        You make it hard for a boy like that to go wrong
        I'm wishing I could make this mine, oh
        If you want it, yeah
        You can have it, oh, oh, oh
        If you need it, oooh

        My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
        I'm trying not to waste my time
        If you want it, oh
        You can have it, you can have it
        If you need it
        You better believe in something
        We can make it

        You can have it, aaaaah!

        Ooh, we get so scandalous
        But stay woke
        But stay woke
Close the door
Not all the way
We don't understand
We don't understand
So don't you go and remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around and oh no, you are not around
I made up more time watchin' you
You got it down now, don't you?
I wanted to understand your face
So don't you go and remind me
I don't know a thing
And some of us remember
And some run out of place
Can I waste all your time here on the sidewalk?
Can I stand in your light just for a while?
I've waited around and oh no, you are are not around
I made up more time watchin' you
Watchin' you
I need someone
I need someone
Please don't come around
Please don't come around
Please don't come around
Please don't, please don't
I was trying to
It's alright (it's alright)
It's alright (it's alright)
If you were 22 forever, would be nice (would be nice)
Would be nice
Why you dare to take that away
I don't understand (I don't understand)
I could name a thousand different reasons you could fight (could fight)
All your might, I know I'm right
I could feel the change (feel the change)
The way you sing your song (the way you sing your song)
I could feel the waves (I could feel the waves)
You send from kingdom's sun (you send from kingdom's sun)
I will find a way
Ooh yeah
I will find myself
And I will love you
With my soul
You're all I've ever wanted
I know that I love you
Still driving
Take my hands in yours, please don't go
I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I will find a way
I will find a way
Yuh, got 'em
Sex, running
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted
Yuh, got 'em
Sex, running
Fuck, got 'em
Look, spotted
You're taking my heart, now
They're taking my heart, now
And I don't know why (come)
And I don't know why (come, come with me)
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright (ayy, ayy, ayy)
The demons told me everything
They whisper in the night (ayy, ayy, ayy)
This is not a threat, I promise (nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise
It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know
That was when the ceiling caved in
When I've fallen in a trench, I'm behaving (skkrt)
I'm behaving myself (uh)
I'm behaving myself (look, look, what, what)
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for you (for you, for you)
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for- (shh, quiet)
This is not a threat, I promise (nope)
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise
It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know
Please just let me go
Let me go, I've seen enough
I've seen enough
I've seen enough
And I said, "what's up?
What you been thinking?"
'Cause you've been staring at that roof so long I'd swear it's come alive
And she spoke nine words
And now we're sinking
But I can't find it in myself to want to lie to keep this thing from going down
'Cause that girl took my heart
And I ain't want it back
No
I'm laying down my cards
'Cause you said it meant nothing
And I should've kept my silence
But I guess I'm too attached to my own pride to let you know
That all these words meant nothing
And I've always been this heartless
And we were just having sex no I would never call it love
But love
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings
And I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?
So I guess it's...
Let die to let live
And what's good
When both choices I've got have us staring down the barrel to the bullets I can't stop?
And so I stand off
Like indecision's Kevlar
'Til this fear of feeling stops and I'm done
But you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
'Cause that girl took my heart
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
And I ain't want it back, no
(No, I don't know how to forget you)
A bulletproof restart
Oh no, I think I'm catching feelings and
I don't know if this is empathy I feel
Just hold on
Remember why you said this was the last time?
So I guess it's...
Let die to let live
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
No, I don't know how to forget you
